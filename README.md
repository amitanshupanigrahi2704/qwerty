# Beyond The Scoreboard : Match Prediction using CatBoost and Pi-Ratings

## Overview  
This project introduces the **pi-rating system**, a novel and efficient method for evaluating football teams based on match score discrepancies. Unlike traditional rating systems that rely on multiple variables, the pi-rating system emphasizes adaptability and efficiency by focusing solely on relative score differences. This approach highlights direct competitive outcomes as the key measure of team superiority.  

By leveraging **CatBoost**, a gradient boosting library designed for handling categorical data, the project achieves advanced predictive capabilities. The integration of pi-ratings with CatBoost enhances forecasting accuracy and demonstrates practical applications in sports analytics and betting strategies.  

## Key Features  
- **Dynamic Rating System**: The pi-rating system adapts to match outcomes and score differences.  
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilizes CatBoost for efficient modeling of team performance and match predictions.  
- **Comparison with ELO Ratings**: Benchmarked against two ELO variants to highlight predictive strength.  
- **Practical Applications**: Tested in football betting strategies, demonstrating consistent profitability against market odds.  

## Methodology  
1. **Pi-Rating System**:  
   - Rates teams dynamically based on match score discrepancies.  
   - Focuses on simplicity and adaptability to match outcomes.  

2. **CatBoost**:  
   - Handles categorical features such as team performance across seasons and competitions.
